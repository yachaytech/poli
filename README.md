# Python On Line Imaging (POLI)
 
This version of POLI is provided for the data processing used in the "eto_weather" project. 

Briefly, POLI can be used as a batch oriented data processor and is used that way for the "eto_weather" project. 

It can also be used with a graphical user interface (see the HOWTO_POLI_GUI). At its core, POLI is stream oriented, so that the output of one operator is used as input to the next operator. Most operatore can also be used in a LINUX/UNIX command line pipe.
